# Atlantis
## Project Overview
Atlantis is a multiplayer local network game experience meant for play by groups in a cinema space through a smartphone controller. Through a series of collaborative and competitive mini games, players experience the collapse of a city and the will of its inhabitants to survive. Together, by tapping, swiping, and yelling, the audience will decide the conclusion of a civilization in a unique co-operative gaming experience.
